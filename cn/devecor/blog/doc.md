# Documentation quadrants

A handy way to ensure the right documentation is being produced.

## Introduction

> It doesn’t matter how good your product is, because if its documentation is not good enough, people will not use it. Even if they have to use it because they have no choice, without good documentation, they won’t use it effectively or the way you’d like them to.

That's the reason we need to follow [document quadrants](https://documentation.divio.com/introduction/) pattern.


> Documentation needs to include and be structured around its four different functions: **tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanation**. Each of them requires a distinct mode of writing.
